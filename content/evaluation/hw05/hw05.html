<div id="overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write some data to file and load it back into R.</li>
<li>Explain the value of the here::here package</li>
<li>Improve a figure (or make one from scratch), using new knowledge, e.g., control the color scheme, use factor levels, smoother mechanics.</li>
<li>Reorder a factor in a principled way based on the data and demonstrate the effect in arranged data and in figures.</li>
<li>Implement visualization design principles.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of this homework is to get you thinking about data portability, collaboration, and dissemination of your work more widely. You will learn to import and export your datasets and also practice effective plotting principles.</p>
<p>Remember your homework should serve as your own personal cheatsheet in the future for canonical tasks. Make things nice – your future self will thank you!</p>

</ul>
<p>Task: Choose <strong>one</strong> dataset (of your choice) and a variable to explore. After ensuring the variable(s) you’re exploring are indeed factors, you should:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Drop factor / levels;</li>
<li>Reorder levels based on knowledge from data.</li>
</ol>
<p>We’ve elaborated on these steps for the gapminder and singer data sets below.</p>
<p>Explore the effects of re-leveling a factor in a tibble by:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>comparing the results of <code>arrange</code> on the original and re-leveled factor.</li>
<li>Plotting a figure of before/after re-leveling the factor (make sure to assign the factor to an <em>aesthetic</em> of your choosing).</li>
</ol>
<p>These explorations should involve the data, the factor levels, and at least two figures (before and after.</p>
<div id="elaboration-for-the-gapminder-data-set" class="section level4">
<h4>Elaboration for the gapminder data set</h4>
<p><strong>Drop Oceania.</strong> Filter the Gapminder data to remove observations associated with the <code>continent</code> of Oceania. Additionally, remove unused factor levels. Provide concrete information on the data before and after removing these rows and Oceania; address the number of rows and the levels of the affected factors.</p>
<p><strong>Reorder the levels of <code>country</code> or <code>continent</code>.</strong> Use the forcats package to change the order of the factor levels, based on summarized information of one of the quantitative variables. Consider experimenting with a summary statistic beyond the most basic choice of the mean/median. Use the <code>forcats</code> package in the tidyverse for this, rather than the baseR function <code>as.factor</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="elaboration-for-the-singer-data-set" class="section level4">
<h4>Elaboration for the Singer data set</h4>
<p>If necessary, transform some of the variables in the <code>singer_locations</code> dataframe into factors: pay attention at what levels you introduce and their order.</p>
<p><strong>Drop 0.</strong> Filter the <code>singer_locations</code> data to remove observations associated with the uncorrectly inputed <code>year</code> 0. Additionally, remove unused factor levels. Provide concrete information on the data before and after removing these rows and levels; address the number of rows and the levels of the affected factors.</p>
<p><strong>Reorder the levels of <code>year</code>, <code>artist_name</code> or <code>title</code>.</strong> Use the forcats package to change the order of the factor levels, based on a principled summary of one of the quantitative variables. Consider experimenting with a summary statistic beyond the most basic choice of the median.</p>

<p>Task: Experiment with at least one of:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>write_csv()/read_csv()</code> (and/or TSV friends),</li>
<li><code>saveRDS()/readRDS()</code>,</li>
<li><code>dput()/dget()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are expected to create something new, probably by filtering or grouped-summarization of your dataset (for e.g., Singer, Gapminder, or another dataset), export it to disk and then reload it back in using one of the packages above. You should use here::here() for reading in and writing out.</p>
<p>With the imported data, play around with factor levels and use factors to order your data with one of your factors (i.e. non-alphabetically). For the I/O method(s) you chose, comment on whether or not your newly created file survived the round trip of writing to file then reading back in.</p>

<p>Go back through your previous assignments and class participation activities and find figures you created prior to the last week of the course. Recreate at least one figure in light of something you learned in the recent class meetings about visualization design and color.</p>
<p>Task: Create a side-by-side plot and juxtapose your first attempt (show the original figure as-is) with a revised attempt after some time spent working on it and implementing principles of effective plotting principles. Comment and reflect on the differences.</p>

</ul>
<p>Task: Use <code>ggsave()</code> to explicitly save a plot to file. Include the exported plot as part of your repository and assignment.</p>
<p>Then, use <code>![Alt text](/path/to/img.png)</code> to load and embed that file into your report. You can play around with various options, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arguments of <code>ggsave()</code>, such as width, height, resolution or text scaling.</li>
<li>Various graphics devices, e.g. a vector vs. raster format.</li>
<li>Explicit provision of the plot object <code>p</code> via <code>ggsave(..., plot = p)</code>. Show a situation in which this actually matters.</li>

<h2>Finishing up and Reflection</h2>
<p>This is your last STAT 545 assignment, but I encourage you not to stop working with R here! Continue exploring datasets - whether they are your datasets, or the thousands of <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html">sample datasets</a> on the internet. If you get stuck, there is a tremendous amount of resources out there including open online textbooks <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz">R for Data Science</a>, <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz">Advanced R for Data Science</a>, the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/index.html">learnr</a> package, and of course, StackOverflow and Google.</p>
<p>Best of luck with your R journey, and hope to see you in STAT 547 in the spring!</p>

<h2>(Optional, ungraded) Exercise 6: But I want to do more!</h2>
<p>If you’re particularly keen on levelling up the challenge of this assignment, try these things (this is all optional, and will not be graded):</p>
<p>Make a deeper exploration of the forcats packages, i.e. try more of the factor level reordering functions.</p>
<p>Revalue a factor, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gapminder version</strong>: Pick a handful of countries, each of which you can associate with a stereotypical food (or any other non-controversial thing … sport? hobby? type of music, art or dance? animal? landscape feature?). Create an excerpt of the Gapminder data, filtered to just these countries. Create a new factor – you pick the name! – by mapping the existing country factor levels to the new levels.
<ul>
<li>Examples: Italy –&gt; wine, Germany –&gt; beer, Japan –&gt; sake. (Austria, Germany) –&gt; German, (Mexico, Spain) –&gt; Spanish, (Portugal, Brazil) –&gt; Portuguese. Let your creativity flourish.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Singer version</strong>: Pick a handful of locations (they are named <code>city</code>, try using <code>distinct()</code>) that you can pinpoint to a geographical place (city, region, country, continent,…). Create an excerpt of the Singer data, filtered to just those rows. Create a (couple of) new factor(s) – you pick the name(s)! – by mapping the existing <code>city</code> factor levels to the new (city, region, country…) levels.
<ul>
<li>Examples: “London, England” –&gt; “London”, “England”, “UK”, “Europe”;<br />
</li>
<li>“Los Angeles, CA” –&gt; “Los Angeles”, “California”, “USA”, “Americas”;</li>
<li>…</li>
<li>“310, Louisiana” –&gt; “New Orleans”, “Louisiana”, “USA”, “Americas”.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>You could even try to make this process of geolocalization more streamlined: you may want to try and use the <code>separate</code> function from tidyr.</p>
